This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) blogging starter template. Version 2 is based on Next App directory with [React Server Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-components) and uses [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) to manage markdown content.

Probably the most feature-rich Next.js markdown blogging template out there. Easily configurable and customizable. Perfect as a replacement to existing Jekyll and Hugo individual blogs.

Check out the documentation below to get started.

## Motivation

I wanted to port my existing blog to Nextjs and Tailwind CSS but there was no easy out of the box template to use so I decided to create one. Design is adapted from [Tailwindlabs blog](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/blog.tailwindcss.com).

I wanted it to be nearly as feature-rich as popular blogging templates like [beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) and [Hugo Academic](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-modules) but with the best of React's ecosystem and current web development's best practices.

## Quick Start Guide

1. Clone the repo

```bash
npx degit 'timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog'
```

2. Personalize `siteMetadata.js` (site related information)
3. Modify the content security policy in `next.config.js` if you want to use
   other analytics provider or a commenting solution other than giscus.
4. Personalize `authors/default.md` (main author)
5. Modify `projectsData.ts`
6. Modify `headerNavLinks.ts` to customize navigation links
7. Add blog posts
8. Deploy on Vercel

## Installation

```bash
yarn
```

Please note, that if you are using Windows, you may need to run:

```bash
set PWD="$(pwd)"
```

```powershell
$PWD = Get-Location
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PWD', $PWD, [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Process)
```

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Edit the layout in `app` or content in `data`. With live reloading, the pages auto-updates as you edit them.

## Extend / Customize

`data/siteMetadata.js` - contains most of the site related information which should be modified for a user's need.

`data/authors/default.md` - default author information (required). Additional authors can be added as files in `data/authors`.

`data/projectsData.js` - data used to generate styled card on the projects page.

`data/headerNavLinks.js` - navigation links.

`data/logo.svg` - replace with your own logo.

`data/blog` - replace with your own blog posts.

`public/static` - store assets such as images and favicons.

`tailwind.config.js` and `css/tailwind.css` - tailwind configuration and stylesheet which can be modified to change the overall look and feel of the site.

`css/prism.css` - controls the styles associated with the code blocks. Feel free to customize it and use your preferred prismjs theme e.g. [prism themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes).

`contentlayer.config.ts` - configuration for Contentlayer, including definition of content sources and MDX plugins used. See [Contentlayer documentation](https://www.contentlayer.dev/docs/getting-started) for more information.

`components/MDXComponents.js` - pass your own JSX code or React component by specifying it over here. You can then use them directly in the `.mdx` or `.md` file. By default, a custom link, `next/image` component, table of contents component and Newsletter form are passed down. Note that the components should be default exported to avoid [existing issues with Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/51593).

`layouts` - main templates used in pages:

- There are currently 3 post layouts available: `PostLayout`, `PostSimple` and `PostBanner`. `PostLayout` is the default 2 column layout with meta and author information. `PostSimple` is a simplified version of `PostLayout`, while `PostBanner` features a banner image.
- There are 2 blog listing layouts: `ListLayout`, the layout used in version 1 of the template with a search bar and `ListLayoutWithTags`, currently used in version 2, which omits the search bar but includes a sidebar with information on the tags.

`app` - pages to route to. Read the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) for more information.

`next.config.js` - configuration related to Next.js. You need to adapt the Content Security Policy if you want to load scripts, images etc. from other domains.

## Post

Content is modelled using [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/), which allows you to define your own content schema and use it to generate typed content objects. See [Contentlayer documentation](https://www.contentlayer.dev/docs/getting-started) for more information.

### Frontmatter

Frontmatter follows [Hugo's standards](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/).

Please refer to `contentlayer.config.ts` for an up to date list of supported fields. The following fields are supported:

```
title (required)
date (required)
tags (optional)
lastmod (optional)
draft (optional)
summary (optional)
images (optional)
authors (optional list which should correspond to the file names in `data/authors`. Uses `default` if none is specified)
layout (optional list which should correspond to the file names in `data/layouts`)
canonicalUrl (optional, canonical url for the post for SEO)
```

Here's an example of a post's frontmatter:

```
---
title: 'Introducing Tailwind Nexjs Starter Blog'
date: '2021-01-12'
lastmod: '2021-01-18'
tags: ['next-js', 'tailwind', 'guide']
draft: false
summary: 'Looking for a performant, out of the box template, with all the best in web technology to support your blogging needs? Checkout the Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog template.'
images: ['/static/images/canada/mountains.jpg', '/static/images/canada/toronto.jpg']
authors: ['default', 'sparrowhawk']
layout: PostLayout
canonicalUrl: https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog/introducing-tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog
---
```

Sure, here’s a section you can add to your `README.md` to describe how to use the script to create a new post:


### Creating a New Blog Post

To create a new blog post, you can use the `newpost` script provided in the project. This script will prompt you for various details about the post, generate the appropriate frontmatter, create a Markdown file with a `.mdx` extension in a date-based directory, and open the file in your specified editor.

#### Steps to Create a New Post

1. **Open your terminal** and navigate to the root directory of the project.

2. **Run the script**:
   ```sh
   npm run newpost
   ```
   By default, this will attempt to detect your current editor or open the file in Visual Studio Code. You can also specify your preferred editor as an argument:
   ```sh
   npm run newpost code   # Open with VSCode
   npm run newpost subl   # Open with Sublime Text
   npm run newpost zed    # Open with Zed
   ```

3. **Answer the prompts**:
   - **Title**: Enter the title of your blog post.
   - **Date**: Enter the date of the post (YYYY-MM-DD). The default is today's date.
   - **Last Modified Date**: Enter the last modified date (YYYY-MM-DD). The default is today's date.
   - **Tags**: Enter tags for the post, separated by commas.
   - **Draft**: Indicate whether the post is a draft.
   - **Summary**: Provide a brief summary of the post.
   - **Images**: Enter paths to images, separated by commas.
   - **Authors**: Enter the authors of the post, separated by commas. The default is `default`.
   - **Layout**: Choose a layout from the provided options (`PostLayout`, `PostSimple`, `PostBanner`).
   - **Canonical URL**: Enter a canonical URL for the post (optional).

4. **Edit the new post file**:
   - After answering the prompts, the script will create a new `.mdx` file in the `data/blog/<date>` directory (where `<date>` is the date you provided).
   - The file will be opened in the specified editor. You can then add your content to the file.

#### Example

Here's an example of how the process looks:

1. Run the script:
   ```sh
   yarn newpost
   ```

2. Answer the prompts in the terminal:
   ```
   ? Enter the post title: My Awesome Blog Post
   ? Enter the post date (YYYY-MM-DD): (default: today) 2024-05-21
   ? Enter the last modified date (YYYY-MM-DD): (default: today) 2024-05-21
   ? Enter tags (comma-separated): tech, javascript, tutorial
   ? Is this a draft? No
   ? Enter a summary: This is a summary of my awesome blog post.
   ? Enter image paths (comma-separated): /static/images/post1.jpg
   ? Enter authors (comma-separated): (default: default) john, jane
   ? Select a layout: PostLayout
   ? Enter canonical URL (optional): 
   ```

3. The script creates and opens the new file `data/blog/2024-05-21/my-awesome-blog-post.mdx` with the following frontmatter:
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: 'My Awesome Blog Post'
   date: '2024-05-21'
   lastmod: '2024-05-21'
   draft: false
   layout: PostLayout
   tags: ['tech', 'javascript', 'tutorial']
   summary: 'This is a summary of my awesome blog post.'
   images: ['/static/images/post1.jpg']
   authors: ['john', 'jane']
   ---
   ```

4. Add your content to the `.mdx` file and save it.

This process helps ensure that all necessary frontmatter is correctly formatted and that your new post is created in the appropriate directory structure.

## Deploy

**Vercel**  
The easiest way to deploy the template is to deploy on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

**Netlify**
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)’s Next.js runtime configures enables key Next.js functionality on your website without the need for additional configurations. Netlify generates serverless functions that will handle Next.js functionalities such as server-side rendered (SSR) pages, incremental static regeneration (ISR), `next/images`, etc.

See [Next.js on Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/next-js/overview/#next-js-runtime) for suggested configuration values and more details.

**Static hosting services / GitHub Pages / S3 / Firebase etc.**

1. Add `output: 'export'` in `next.config.js`. See [static exports documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#configuration) for more information.
2. Comment out `headers()` from `next.config.js`.
3. Add `unoptimized: true` to the `images` key in `next.config.js`:

   Alternatively, to continue using `next/image`, you can use an alternative image optimization provider such as Imgix, Cloudinary or Akamai. See [image optimization documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#image-optimization) for more details.

4. Remove `api` folder and components which call the server-side function such as the Newsletter component. Not technically required and the site will build successfully, but the APIs cannot be used as they are server-side functions.
5. Run `yarn build`. The generated static content is in the `out` folder.
6. Deploy the `out` folder to your hosting service of choice or run `npx serve out` to view the website locally.

**Note**: Deploying on Github pages require addition modifications to the base path. Please refer to the FAQ for more information.
